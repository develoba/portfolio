This project was made as a way to practice frontend skills with a basic stack, which could be used in a web development company as a product for a client. I started from an initial design and made the page for a spanish music streaming service. The most noticeable aspects of this project are the responsiveness for every screen sizes, where images and ohter elements changes their position according to the size in a smooth way. Moreover, the use of grids and flex boxes were used, which is an essential tool for a page layout.

# Tech stack
This project follows a basic web development stack:

* ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
* ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
* ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
  
## Libraries used
No libraries were needed in this project, since it follows a basic layout and it was only made to practice frontend skills. There is no backend or any active interaction. However, for the styling part, Bootstrap framework was used.


# Motivation
The main motivation of this project was to make a layout that could be perfectly for a client or a company, since it is very similar from other page layouts available in the market. Moreover, the prrimary goal was to master basic frontend tech as CSS and Bootstrap, so that I can start more complex project and learn other frameworks as React and Tailwind.


# Detailed Implementation
In more details, the project was based on a responsive layout, using for that flexbox and css grid styles. Most of those layouts were made using Bootstrap classes added in HTML elements. Absolute positioning was also applied to several images so that their position changes when the screen size is smaller. 

## Design
Regarding the design, one main color was used, which is purple, combined with three other loud colors, whereas the background was made of different light colors. One main font was used for every title, whereas a simpler font was used for the text

### Colors
Colors that were used in this project:
* ![#936CDF](https://placehold.co/20x20/936CDF/936CDF.png) `#936CDF` &rarr; main purple
* ![#F56823](https://placehold.co/20x20/F56823/F56823.png) `#F56823`
* ![#1FAFA4](https://placehold.co/20x20/1FAFA4/1FAFA4.png) `#1FAFA4`  
* ![#E0A12C](https://placehold.co/20x20/E0A12C/E0A12C.png) `#E0A12C`  
* ![#0165C1](https://placehold.co/20x20/0165C1/0165C1.png) `#0165C1`  
  
### Fonts
* [Playfair display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfair) &rarr; titles
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) &rarr; text

## HTML

The markup follows a semantic structure, using `header`, `main` and `footer` tags, and also dividing each part of the layout with `section` tags. The classnames used in each element are mostly from Bootstrap

### Highlights:

* Semantic HTML
* Bootstrap

## CSS

This project was mostly styled by using Bootstrap; however, some styles were applied with pure CSS, as absolute positioning and responsiveness. 

### Highlights:
* Bootstrap components
* Flexbox and grid

## JS

Lastly for the stack used, only a small script was created from scratch, which was for the shadow of the navigation element when it is on small screen. For the rest of the project, since bootstrap components were used, Javascript from bootstrap was also applied, for example the use of a hamburger menu on smaller sizes.


## Responsiveness

As mentioned, this project is responsive in any size, having some fading transitions when resizing the screen. The preview of desktop, tablet and mobile are shown:

<p align="top">
    <img align="top" src="./img/desktopPreview.png" width="50%"> 
    <img align="top" src="./img/tabletPreview.png" width="20%"> 
    <img align="top" src="./img/mobilePreview.png" width="10%">
</p>
